Introduction to Deep Learning

Paragraphs:
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural networks. It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data. In deep learning, we don’t need to explicitly program everything. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the advances in processing power and the availability of large datasets. Because it is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) also known as deep neural networks (DNNs). These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s biological neurons, and they are designed to learn from large amounts of data.
In summary, Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that involves the use of deep neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Deep Learning has achieved significant success in various fields, and its use is expected to continue to grow as more data becomes available, and more powerful computing resources become available.
Deep learning is the branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.
In a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.
Today Deep learning has become one of the most popular and visible areas of machine learning, due to its success in a variety of applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and Reinforcement learning.
Deep learning can be used for supervised, unsupervised as well as reinforcement machine learning. it uses a variety of ways to process these.
Artificial neural networks are built on the principles of the structure and operation of human neurons. It is also known as neural networks or neural nets. An artificial neural network’s input layer, which is the first layer, receives input from external sources and passes it on to the hidden layer, which is the second layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer gets information from the neurons in the previous layer, computes the weighted total, and then transfers it to the neurons in the next layer. These connections are weighted, which means that the impacts of the inputs from the preceding layer are more or less optimized by giving each input a distinct weight. These weights are then adjusted during the training process to enhance the performance of the model.
Fully Connected Artificial Neural Network
Artificial neurons, also known as units, are found in artificial neural networks. The whole Artificial Neural Network is composed of these artificial neurons, which are arranged in a series of layers. The complexities of neural networks will depend on the complexities of the underlying patterns in the dataset whether a layer has a dozen units or millions of units.  Commonly, Artificial Neural Network has an input layer, an output layer as well as hidden layers. The input layer receives data from the outside world which the neural network needs to analyze or learn about.
In a fully connected artificial neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. Then, after passing through one or more hidden layers, this data is transformed into valuable data for the output layer. Finally, the output layer provides an output in the form of an artificial neural network’s response to the data that comes in.
Units are linked to one another from one layer to another in the bulk of neural networks. Each of these links has weights that control how much one unit influences another. The neural network learns more and more about the data as it moves from one unit to another, ultimately producing an output from the output layer.
machine learning and deep learning both are subsets of artificial intelligence but there are many similarities and differences between them.

Deep Learning
Deep Learning models are able to automatically learn features from the data, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The most widely used architectures in deep learning are feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are the simplest type of ANN, with a linear flow of information through the network. FNNs have been widely used for tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically for image and video recognition tasks. CNNs are able to automatically learn features from the images, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that is able to process sequential data, such as time series and natural language. RNNs are able to maintain an internal state that captures information about the previous inputs, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and language translation.
The main applications of deep learning can be divided into computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning.
