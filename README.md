# Web Scraping

## Project Overview
This repository holds my completed work for the Web Scraping Lab as part of the Data Science program. The lab's primary focus was on understanding and implementing web scraping techniques to collect, clean, and process data from various online sources. The tasks were aimed at teaching the ethical collection of dynamic data, including textual and numerical information, from websites.

## Description of Tasks
- **Task 1:** Scraped headlines and textual content from websites on specified topics, converting data into a text file.
- **Task 2:** Scraped product names and prices from an e-commerce site, with results stored in a CSV file.
- **Task 3:** Collected weather data from multiple sources, focusing on error handling and data storage.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for scripting the web scraping tasks.
- **BeautifulSoup & Requests:** Used for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, making HTTP requests to web servers.
- **Pandas:** Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for organizing data into CSV format in Task 2.

## How to Navigate This Repository
- Each task folder contains:
  - **Script:** Python code file (.ipynb) with comments explaining the code and approach.
  - **Data File:** Output of the script in .txt or .csv format, depending on the task.

## Final Notes
This lab was a thorough introduction to web scraping, covering not just the technical aspects but also ethical considerations and data quality assessment. It's designed for those interested in data science, especially in fields that require gathering and analyzing large amounts of data from the internet.
